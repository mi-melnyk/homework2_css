# Python Bootcamp: Assignment 3 [100 points]

This week we will start writing some code! This assignment is designed to be a crash-course to get you up to speed on the level of Python you will need to know in order to do the remainder of the assignments. It's easiest to learn by doing, so please start early so we can help you get on board. You want to spend the semester focusing on the crowdsourcing and machine learning, not the indenting and semicoloning.

Before you do anything save a copy of this file in Drive (found in File) and work on that one.

## 1. Working with Lists [15 points]

1. **[5 points]** Consider the function `extract_and_apply(l, p, f)` shown below, which extracts the elements of a list `l` satisfying a boolean predicate `p`, applies a function f to each such element, and returns the result.

  Rewrite `extract_and_apply(l, p, f)` in one line using a list comprehension.
"""

def extract_and_apply(l, p, f):
     result = []
     for x in l:
         if p(x):
             result.append(f(x))
     return result

def extract_and_apply(l, p, f):
     return [f(x) for x in l if p(x)]

# # Example:
l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
p = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
f = lambda x: x
extract_and_apply(l, p, f)

# Expected output:
# [2, 4]

"""2. **[5 points]** Write a function `concatenate(seqs)` that returns a list containing the concatenation of the elements of the input sequences. Your implementation should consist of a single list comprehension, and should not exceed one line.


"""

def concatenate(seqs):
    return [element for seq in seqs for element in seq]

# Example:
concatenate([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# Expected output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Example:
concatenate(["abc", (0, [0])])

# Expected output:
# ['a', 'b', 'c', 0, [0]]

"""3. **[5 points]** Write a function `transpose(matrix)` that returns the transpose of the input matrix, which is represented as a list of lists. Recall that the transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows with its columns. More concretely, the equality `matrix[i][j] == transpose(matrix)[j][i`] should hold for all valid indices `i` and `j`. You may assume that the input matrix is well-formed, i.e., that each row is of equal length. You may further assume that the input matrix is non-empty. Your function should not modify the input."""

def transpose(matrix):
  return [[matrix[i][j] for i in range(len(matrix))] for j in range(len(matrix[0]))]

# Example:
transpose([[1, 2, 3]])

# Expected output:
# [[1], [2], [3]]

# Example:
transpose([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])

# Expected output:
# [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]

"""## 2. Sequence Slicing [9 points]

The functions in this section should be implemented using sequence slices. Recall that the slice parameters take on sensible default values when omitted. In some cases, it may be necessary to use the optional third parameter to specify a step size.

1. **[3 points]** Write a function `copy(seq)` that returns a new sequence containing the same elements as the input sequence.
"""

def copy(seq):
    return seq[:]

# Example:
copy("abc")

# Expected output:
# 'abc'

# Example:
copy((1, 2, 3))

# Expected output:
#  (1, 2, 3)

# Example:
x = [0, 0, 0]
y = copy(x)
print(x, y)

x[0] = 1
print(x, y)

# Expected output:
# [0, 0, 0] [0, 0, 0]
# [1, 0, 0] [0, 0, 0]

"""2. **[3 points]** Write a function `all_but_last(seq)` that returns a new sequence containing all but the last element of the input sequence. If the input sequence is empty, a new empty sequence of the same type should be returned."""

def all_but_last(seq):
    return seq[:-1]

# Example:
all_but_last("abc")

# Expected output:
# 'ab'

# Example:
all_but_last((1, 2, 3))

# Expected output:
# (1, 2)

# Example:
all_but_last("")

# Expected output:
# ''

# Example:
all_but_last([])

# Expected output:
# []

"""3. **[3 points]** Write a function `every_other(seq)` that returns a new sequence containing every other element of the input sequence, starting with the first. This function can be written in one line using the optional third parameter of the slice notation."""

def every_other(seq):
    return seq[::2]

# Example:
every_other([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Expected output:
# [1, 3, 5]

# Example:
every_other("abcde")

# Expected output:
# 'ace'

# Example:
every_other([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Expected output:
# [1, 3, 5]

# Example:
every_other("abcdef")

# Expected output:
# 'ace'

"""## 3. Combinatorial Algorithms [12 points]

The functions in this section should be implemented as generators. You may generate the output in any order you find convenient, as long as the correct elements are produced. However, in some cases, you may find that the order of the example output hints at a possible implementation.

Although generators in Python can be used in a variety of ways, you will not need to use any of their more sophisticated features here. Simply keep in mind that where you might normally return a list of elements, you should instead yield the individual elements.

Since the contents of a generator cannot be viewed without employing some form of iteration, we wrap all function calls in this section’s examples with the list function for convenience.

1. **[6 points]** The prefixes of a sequence include the empty sequence, the first element, the first two elements, etc., up to and including the full sequence itself. Similarly, the suffixes of a sequence include the empty sequence, the last element, the last two elements, etc., up to and including the full sequence itself. Write a pair of functions `prefixes(seq)` and `suffixes(seq)` that yield all prefixes and suffixes of the input sequence.
"""

def prefixes(seq):
    for i in range(len(seq) + 1):
        yield seq[:i]

def suffixes(seq):
    for i in range(len(seq) + 1):
        yield seq[i:]

# Example:
list(prefixes([1, 2, 3]))

# Expected output:
# [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3]]

# Example:
list(suffixes([1, 2, 3]))

# Expected output:
# [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [3], []]

# Example:
list(prefixes("abc"))

# Expected output:
# ['', 'a', 'ab', 'abc']

# Example:
list(suffixes("abc"))

# Expected output:
# ['abc', 'bc', 'c', '']

"""2. **[6 points]** Write a function `slices(seq)` that yields all non-empty slices of the input sequence."""

def slices(seq):
    for start in range(len(seq)):
        for end in range(start + 1, len(seq) + 1):
            yield seq[start:end]

# Example:
list(slices([1, 2, 3]))

# Expected output:
# [[1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]

# Example:
list(slices("abc"))

# Expected output:
# ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'b', 'bc', 'c']

"""## 4. Text Processing [20 points]

1. **[5 points]** A common preprocessing step in many natural language processing tasks is text normalization, wherein words are converted to lowercase, extraneous whitespace is removed, etc. Write a function `normalize(text)` that returns a normalized version of the input string, in which all words have been converted to lowercase and are separated by a single space. No leading or trailing whitespace should be present in the output.
"""

def normalize(text):
    return ' '.join(text.lower().split())

# Example:
normalize("This is an example.")

# Expected output:
# 'this is an example.'

# Example:
normalize("   EXTRA   SPACE   ")

# Expected output:
# 'extra space'

"""2. **[5 points]** Write a function `no_vowels(text)` that removes all vowels from the input string and returns the result. For the purposes of this problem, the letter ‘y’ is not considered to be a vowel.


"""

def no_vowels(text):
    return ''.join([char for char in text if char.lower() not in 'aeiou'])

# Example:
no_vowels("This Is An Example.")

# Expected output:
# 'Ths s n xmpl.'

# Example:
no_vowels("We love Python!")

# Expected output:
# 'W lv Pythn!'

"""3. **[5 points]** Write a function `digits_to_words(text)` that extracts all digits from the input string, spells them out as lowercase English words, and returns a new string in which they are each separated by a single space. If the input string contains no digits, then an empty string should be returned."""

def digits_to_words(text):
    digit_map = {
        '0': 'zero', '1': 'one', '2': 'two', '3': 'three',
        '4': 'four', '5': 'five', '6': 'six',
        '7': 'seven', '8': 'eight', '9': 'nine'
    }
    return ' '.join([digit_map[char] for char in text if char.isdigit()])

# Example:
digits_to_words("Zip Code: 19104")

# Expected output:
# 'one nine one zero four'

# Example:
digits_to_words("Pi is 3.1415...")

# Expected output:
# 'three one four one five'

"""4. **[5 points]** Although there exist many naming conventions in computer programming, two of them are particularly widespread. In the first, words in a variable name are separated using underscores. In the second, words in a variable name are written in mixed case, and are strung together without a delimiter. By mixed case, we mean that the first word is written in lowercase, and that subsequent words have a capital first letter. Write a function `to_mixed_case(name)` that converts a variable `name` from the former convention to the latter. Leading and trailing underscores should be ignored. If the variable name consists solely of underscores, then an empty string should be returned.


"""

def to_mixed_case(name):
    parts = [word for word in name.strip('_').split('_') if word]
    if not parts:
        return ''
    return parts[0].lower() + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in parts[1:])

# Example:
to_mixed_case("to_mixed_case")

# Expected output:
# 'toMixedCase'

# Example:
to_mixed_case("__EXAMPLE__NAME__")

# Expected output:
# 'exampleName'

"""## 5. DataFrames [44 points]
In this section you'll get a feel for pandas' DataFrames a datastructure similar to SQL tables that can directly read lists and csvs and supports a number of optimized operations.

### 5.1 Manipulating a csv [30 points]

"""6. **[10 points]** As we talked about in class workers can use tools to accept batches of HITs at once and then work on them sequentially. We suspect some of the workers in this batch have been using such a tool and that their work times overestimate how long they actually spent working. Write a method to calculate how long each worker actually spent working.
